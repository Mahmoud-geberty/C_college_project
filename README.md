# C_college_project

## Project objective
The project is to simulate receiving river water quality data from sensors, remove outliers from the data 
and do the required calculations to determine the water quality. 

## Approach
The project itself was simple and could've been solved with much simpler code. However at the time of making the project,
I was curious about many things so I used the project as a playground to explore many C programming related concepts. 

The explored concepts include automatic builds with GNU Make, Automated Unit tests and I even colored the terminal outputs and 
made animations that showed how the code was solving the problem step by step.

The code was tested on Linux. It would require some tweaking to run on windows because I used Bash for the tests. And the terminal
output colors only works with linux.
